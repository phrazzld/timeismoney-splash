# T013: Production Deployment Verification Report

## Deployment Status

- **Vercel Preview URL**: https://timeismoney-splash.vercel.app (accessible)
- **Production URL**: https://timeismoney.works (not accessible - ETIMEDOUT)

## Environment Configuration Issues

### Critical Issue: Missing Production Environment Variables

All SEO URLs are using `http://localhost:3000` instead of production URLs. This indicates the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` environment variable is not configured in the Vercel deployment.

## SEO Verification Results

### 1. Page Metadata

✅ **Title**: "Convert Prices to Work Hours" (correct page-specific title)
✅ **Meta Description**: Properly set with landing page specific content
❌ **Canonical URL**: `http://localhost:3000` (should be production URL)
✅ **Open Graph Title**: "Time is Money" (using global default)
✅ **Open Graph Description**: Present with global default content
❌ **Open Graph URL**: `http://localhost:3000` (should be production URL)

### 2. Robots.txt

✅ **Status**: 200, serving content
✅ **User-Agent**: `*` (all crawlers)
✅ **Allow**: `/` (permits all paths)
❌ **Sitemap URL**: `http://localhost:3000/sitemap.xml` (should be production URL)

### 3. Sitemap.xml

✅ **Status**: 200, valid XML structure
✅ **Format**: Proper sitemap XML schema
❌ **URL Entry**: `http://localhost:3000` (should be production URL)
✅ **Change Frequency**: monthly (appropriate)
✅ **Priority**: 1.0 (appropriate for single page)

## Social Media Debug Tools

Cannot verify with social media debug tools because:

1. Production URL (timeismoney.works) is not accessible
2. Preview deployment uses localhost URLs which aren't crawlable

## Required Actions

1. **Configure Vercel Environment Variables**:

   - Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` in Vercel project settings:
     - Production: `https://timeismoney.works`
     - Preview: Use appropriate preview URL pattern

2. **Deploy to Production**:

   - Ensure domain is properly configured
   - Deploy with correct environment variables

3. **Re-verify After Configuration**:
   - All URLs should use production domain
   - Test with social media debug tools
   - Verify production domain is accessible

## Conclusion

The SEO implementation code is correct, but deployment configuration is incomplete. The `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` environment variable must be set in Vercel for production deployment to work correctly.
