## Technical Overview: `timeismoney` Project

This document presents a high-level technical overview of the `timeismoney` project, a Chrome extension designed to convert online prices into equivalent working hours. It summarizes the purpose, architecture, and key file roles across the project's core directories.

**Purpose:**

The `timeismoney` Chrome extension aims to help users make informed purchasing decisions by displaying the cost of items in terms of the time required to earn that amount, based on the user's configured hourly wage. The extension injects content scripts into web pages to detect prices, convert them to time equivalents, and modify the DOM accordingly. It provides an options page for configuration and a popup UI for quick access.

**Architecture:**

The project follows a modular architecture, with a clear separation of concerns across multiple directories:

- **`/` (Root Directory):** Contains top-level configuration and documentation files, including the `package.json` for dependency management and build scripts.
- **`_locales`:** Stores localization resources for internationalization (i18n). Each subdirectory within `_locales` represents a specific language and contains a `messages.json` file with translated strings.
- **`images`:** (Assumed) Stores image assets used within the extension (logos, icons, etc.).
- **`scripts`:** Contains shell scripts and a JavaScript file for building, testing, and loading the extension. These scripts automate the development lifecycle.
- **`src`:** Houses the core source code, further divided into subdirectories:
  - `background`: Contains the service worker script for managing the extension's lifecycle.
  - `content`: Houses the content script injected into web pages.
  - `options`: Contains the code and resources for the options page.
  - `popup`: Includes the UI and logic for the popup window.
  - `utils`: Provides reusable utility modules.
  - `__tests__`: Contains unit and integration tests.

The codebase primarily utilizes JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The extension leverages the Chrome Extension API for various functionalities, and a build process (likely using `esbuild`) bundles and minifies the code for distribution.

**Key File Roles:**

- **`manifest.json` (in `src`):** The Chrome Extension manifest file, defining the extension's metadata, permissions, content scripts, background script, and other configurations.
- **`_locales/[language_code]/messages.json`:** Contains key-value pairs for translated strings in each language.
- **`scripts/build-extension.sh`:** Build script that bundles and packages the extension.
- **`scripts/load-extension.sh`:** Script for loading the extension locally for testing.
- **`scripts/smoke-test.js`:** Node.js script for basic validation of the built extension.
- **`src/background/background.js`:** (Bundled as `background/background.bundle.js`) The service worker script.
- **`src/content/index.js`:** (Bundled as `content/content.bundle.js`) The entry point for the content script.
- **`src/options/index.html`:** The HTML file for the options page.
- **`src/options/index.js`:** The JavaScript file that controls the behavior of the options page.
- **`src/popup/index.html`:** The HTML file for the popup window.
- **`src/popup/popup.js`:** The JavaScript file that controls the behavior of the popup window.
- **`package.json`:** Defines project dependencies, build scripts, and metadata.
- **`jest.config.cjs`:** Configuration file for the Jest testing framework.
- **`jest.setup.cjs`:** Setup file for Jest tests, mocking the Chrome APIs.

**Important Dependencies and Gotchas:**

- **Chrome Extension API:** Extensive use of the Chrome Extension API for storage, i18n, tabs, and other browser functionalities.
- **Manifest V3:** The extension is built using Manifest V3, requiring a service worker for background tasks.
- **Node.js and npm:** The build and test processes rely on Node.js and npm for dependency management and script execution.
- **`esbuild`:** Used for bundling JavaScript files.
- **`zip` command:** The `build-extension.sh` script depends on the `zip` command.
- **Babel:** Used for transforming JavaScript code.
- **Jest:** Utilized as the testing framework.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Careful attention needed to configure CSP to prevent security vulnerabilities.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Proper handling of asynchronous operations is crucial.
- **DOM Manipulation:** Content script manipulates the DOM, which can be fragile.
- **Regular Expressions:** Used for price detection, requiring accurate and robust patterns.
- **Testing Infrastructure:** The project is in the process of migrating existing tests to utilize helper functions to improve test reliability and consistency.

This overview provides a comprehensive understanding of the `timeismoney` project's structure, purpose, and key components.
