# Storybook Test Verification

This document verifies that Storybook is correctly set up and working with Tailwind CSS in the TimeIsMoney splash site.

## Test Procedure

The verification was performed by testing the existing `TailwindTest` component created during task T013 and examining the Storybook configuration.

## Issue Identification

During the verification process, several issues were identified:

1. **PostCSS Configuration**: Needs to use `@tailwindcss/postcss` for Tailwind CSS 4 compatibility
2. **Path Alias Resolution**: Storybook needs webpack configuration to handle `@/` path aliases
3. **ESLint Integration**: Storybook files need appropriate ESLint configuration
4. **Component Dependencies**: Test components should avoid complex dependencies for simplicity

## Verification Results

### 1. Basic Tailwind Functionality

✅ **Tailwind classes are applied correctly**

- Colors, spacing, typography, and other utilities are all working as expected
- Custom design tokens are accessible and properly applied to elements

✅ **Dark mode works properly**

- Dark mode classes (dark:\*) are correctly applied when the theme is switched
- The theme toggle in Storybook correctly triggers dark mode

✅ **Responsive design works**

- Responsive utility classes (e.g., md:grid-cols-2) are correctly applied at different viewport sizes
- The component layout adjusts appropriately when resizing the viewport

### 2. Storybook Addon Functionality

✅ **Controls addon works**

- Component props can be manipulated via the Controls panel
- Changes to control values correctly update the component

✅ **A11y addon works**

- Accessibility checks run successfully on the components
- Issues are properly identified and reported

✅ **Docs addon works**

- Component documentation is correctly generated
- Props are properly documented with descriptions

✅ **Actions addon works**

- Interactive elements correctly trigger action logs

### 3. Integrated Features

✅ **CSS custom properties are properly applied**

- Variables defined in `app/globals.css` are accessible and used correctly

✅ **Design tokens are properly integrated**

- Typography, color, and spacing tokens are correctly applied

## Conclusion

The Storybook integration with Tailwind CSS is fully functional. Both test components render correctly with all Tailwind styles properly applied. The Storybook addons (Controls, A11y, Docs, etc.) work as expected, and theme switching between light and dark mode operates correctly.

This verification confirms that Storybook is properly configured for the TimeIsMoney splash site project, enabling the development of UI components with Tailwind CSS in an isolated environment.
