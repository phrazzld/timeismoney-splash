## Overview

### Our Accessibility Commitment

We are committed to creating inclusive digital experiences that work for everyone, including users with disabilities. Our accessibility standards ensure:

- **Universal Access**: All functionality is accessible via keyboard, screen reader, and other assistive technologies
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: Meeting internationally recognized accessibility standards
- **Performance**: Accessibility features don't compromise site performance
- **Maintainability**: Accessibility is built into our development process, not bolted on

### Success Metrics

- ✅ **Zero critical/serious accessibility violations** in automated testing
- ✅ **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance** across all user flows
- ✅ **4.5:1 color contrast** for normal text, 3:1 for large text and UI components
- ✅ **100% keyboard accessibility** for all interactive elements
- ✅ **Complete screen reader compatibility** with proper ARIA implementation

## Team Responsibilities

## Testing Framework

### 3-Layer Testing Approach

#### Layer 1: Automated Testing (Foundation)

**Tools**: axe-core, Playwright, custom utilities  
**Frequency**: Every commit, CI/CD pipeline  
**Coverage**: ~70% of accessibility issues

```bash
# Comprehensive automated testing
pnpm test:a11y
pnpm test:a11y:report
```

**What it catches:**

- Missing alt text and labels
- Color contrast violations
- Invalid ARIA usage
- Semantic HTML issues
- Basic keyboard navigation problems

#### Layer 2: Enhanced Testing (Validation)

**Tools**: Custom keyboard testing, advanced ARIA validation  
**Frequency**: Per feature, sprint testing  
**Coverage**: ~20% of accessibility issues

```bash
# Enhanced testing suite
pnpm test:e2e keyboard-navigation-comprehensive.spec.ts
```

**What it catches:**

- Complex keyboard interaction patterns
- Dynamic content accessibility
- Advanced ARIA compliance
- Cross-component integration issues

#### Layer 3: Manual Testing (Experience)

**Tools**: Screen readers, assistive technologies, manual procedures  
**Frequency**: Pre-release, major feature launches  
**Coverage**: ~10% of accessibility issues (but critical ones)

**What it catches:**

- Real user experience issues
- Subjective usability problems
- Edge cases in assistive technology
- Context-dependent accessibility barriers

### Test Coverage Matrix

| ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Color Contrast**      | ✅ Pre-commit validation | ✅ Browser-based verification   | ⚪ Visual review       |
| **Keyboard Navigation** | ✅ Basic tab order       | ✅ Component-specific behaviors | ✅ Full user flows     |
| **Screen Reader**       | ✅ ARIA compliance       | ✅ Dynamic content              | ✅ Complete navigation |
| **Focus Management**    | ✅ Focus indicators      | ✅ Focus trapping               | ✅ User experience     |
| **Content Structure**   | ✅ Semantic HTML         | ✅ Heading hierarchy            | ✅ Reading flow        |

## Standards and Requirements

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance

#### Perceivable

- **Color Contrast**: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- **Images**: Descriptive alt text for informative images, empty alt="" for decorative
- **Color Information**: Information not conveyed by color alone
- **Zoom**: Content readable and functional at 200% zoom

#### Operable

- **Keyboard Access**: All functionality available via keyboard
- **No Keyboard Traps**: Users can navigate away from any component
- **Focus Indicators**: Visible focus indicators with 3:1 contrast minimum
- **Timing**: No time limits on reading or interaction

#### Understandable

- **Page Title**: Descriptive page titles
- **Labels**: Clear labels for all form inputs
- **Error Messages**: Clear, helpful error descriptions
- **Instructions**: Clear instructions for complex interactions

#### Robust

- **Valid HTML**: Code validates and works across browsers
- **ARIA**: Proper ARIA implementation for dynamic content
- **Assistive Technology**: Compatible with screen readers and other tools

### Color Standards

```typescript
// Color contrast requirements
const CONTRAST_REQUIREMENTS = {
  normalText: 4.5, // 14pt+ regular, 18pt+ bold
  largeText: 3.0, // 18pt+ regular, 14pt+ bold
  uiComponents: 3.0, // Buttons, inputs, borders
  focusIndicators: 3.0, // Focus outlines and indicators
};
```

**Validation Process:**

1. **Design Phase**: Use contrast checkers during design
2. **Development**: Automated validation via `pnpm validate:contrast`
3. **Testing**: Browser-based validation in CI
4. **Review**: Manual verification in different lighting conditions

### Keyboard Navigation Standards

#### Tab Order Requirements

- **Logical Flow**: Left-to-right, top-to-bottom
- **Skip Links**: Available for efficient navigation
- **No Orphans**: Every focusable element must be reachable
- **Performance**: Complete navigation in under 50 tab stops

#### Component-Specific Behaviors

```typescript
// Standard keyboard patterns
const KEYBOARD_PATTERNS = {
  buttons: ['Enter', 'Space'], // Activate buttons
  links: ['Enter'], // Follow links
  checkboxes: ['Space'], // Toggle checkboxes
  radioButtons: ['ArrowUp', 'ArrowDown'], // Select options
  modals: ['Escape'], // Close dialogs
};
```

#### Focus Management

- **Visible Indicators**: Always visible, high contrast
- **Focus Trapping**: In modals and complex widgets
- **Return Focus**: After modal close or navigation
- **Skip Options**: For repetitive navigation
