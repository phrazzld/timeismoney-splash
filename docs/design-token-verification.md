# Design Token Verification

This document captures the results of the visual verification of design tokens (T011) applied to UI elements in both light and dark modes.

## Testing Process

1. Created a comprehensive test component (`components/test/DesignTokenTest.tsx`) that displays all design tokens:

   - Brand colors (primary, secondary, accent)
   - UI colors (background, foreground, card, muted, etc.)
   - Typography styles (headings, body text, utility text, code)
   - Spacing tokens
   - Interactive elements styled with tokens

2. Temporarily added the test component to the main page (`app/page.tsx`)

3. Verified the correct application of design tokens in both light and dark modes

## Verification Results

### Brand Colors

✅ **Primary Colors**: The primary green color from the hourglass logo correctly appears in the UI with consistent hover and light variants
✅ **Secondary Colors**: Teal-green secondary colors render as expected
✅ **Accent Colors**: Sand/gold accent colors display correctly

### UI Colors

✅ **Background/Foreground**: Colors switch properly between light and dark modes
✅ **Card/Popover**: UI surface colors render correctly and have proper contrast with text
✅ **Muted/Border**: Subtle UI colors display correctly for secondary elements
✅ **Semantic Colors**: Error, warning, success colors appear as intended

### Typography

✅ **Font Families**: Geist Sans and Geist Mono are properly applied
✅ **Font Sizes**: Scale from xs to 9xl renders correctly with appropriate contrast between sizes
✅ **Headings**: Heading styles (h1-h6) display with appropriate size, weight, and spacing
✅ **Body Text**: Body text variants display correctly with proper line height
✅ **Utility Text**: Caption, overline, and label text styles render as expected
✅ **Code Text**: Monospace formatting appears correctly for code blocks and inline code

### Spacing

✅ **Base Unit Scale**: The 8px-based spacing system applies consistently to UI elements
✅ **Component Spacing**: Padding, margins, and gaps between elements display with proper proportions

### Theme Switching

✅ **Light Mode**: All color tokens display correctly in light mode
✅ **Dark Mode**: All color tokens switch appropriately when toggling to dark mode
✅ **Contrast**: Text remains legible against backgrounds in both modes

## Conclusion

All design tokens are correctly applied to UI elements as specified in the design token files. The Tailwind configuration is properly set up to use these tokens, and the CSS custom properties in `app/globals.css` are working as expected.

The design system maintains visual consistency and proper accessibility contrast in both light and dark modes. The tokens provide a solid foundation for building UI components with consistent styling throughout the application.

## Next Steps

1. Remove the temporary test component from the main page
2. Consider adapting the test component into a Storybook story for future reference and regression testing
