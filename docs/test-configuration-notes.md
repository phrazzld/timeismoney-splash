# Test Configuration Notes

## Jest Configuration Issues

During the implementation of accessibility tests for the Icon component (T024), several issues were encountered with the Jest testing configuration:

1. The Jest configuration was initially set up to only match `.ts` files, not `.tsx` files
2. The test environment was set to 'node' instead of 'jsdom' which is required for DOM testing
3. Missing dependencies for React Testing Library and jest-axe
4. Issues with JSX transformation in tests

### Attempted Fixes

The following changes were made to try to address these issues:

1. Updated `jest.config.js` to include:

   - Changed test environment to 'jsdom'
   - Added `.tsx` files to testMatch patterns
   - Updated transform configuration to handle JSX
   - Added transformIgnorePatterns to handle lucide-react
   - Added setupFilesAfterEnv with jest.setup.js

2. Created a `jest.setup.js` file to include testing-library/jest-dom

3. Installed additional dependencies:
   - jest-axe and @types/jest-axe for accessibility testing
   - @testing-library/jest-dom for DOM matchers
   - @testing-library/react for React component testing
   - @testing-library/dom to satisfy peer dependencies

### Next Steps

Further work may be needed to fully resolve the testing configuration issues:

1. Consider using a more complete Jest preset for Next.js applications
2. Ensure the Jest configuration aligns with the project's TypeScript configuration
3. Update the testing approach to better match the application's architecture
4. Consider adding a Babel configuration specifically for tests

Despite these configuration issues, the accessibility tests have been implemented in the codebase and are ready to be run once the environment issues are resolved.
